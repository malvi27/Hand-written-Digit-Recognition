fully connected neural network model for recognising the handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset (A subset of NIST Dataset)
Trained the model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and optimized with categorical crossentropy loss.
The model was trained on a medium-scale dataset, achieving an accuracy of 90%, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognising the digits.
Dataset is loaded using the Kaggle API.
